Title: Handling rdf:ID and rdf:about Attributes

High-Level Instruction: The CIMXML standard allows the use of both `rdf:ID` and `rdf:about` attributes for identifying objects. Ensure that the serializer can handle both attributes correctly. Prefer using `rdf:about` with the format 'urn:uuid:...' when generating new identifiers, but maintain compatibility with existing `rdf:ID` usage.

Specific Code Changes:

1. Update the `subject` function to handle both `rdf:ID` and `rdf:about` attributes when serializing objects. 
2. When generating new identifiers, use the `rdf:about` attribute with the "urn:uuid:..." format.
